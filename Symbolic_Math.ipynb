        "Python offers the SymPy library, a powerful tool for symbolic mathematics. One can use this library to perform symbolic math functions such as taking derivatives, taking integrals, and solving for variables.  SymPy is pre-installed in Google Colab.  If you are in some other environment, SymPy may not yet be installed and you will need the code below:\n",
